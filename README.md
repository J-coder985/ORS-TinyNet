# Overview
RS-TinyNet is an effective framework tailored for tiny object detection in RS imagery. It is guided by two newly introduced principles, namely tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction, and accordingly develops a stage-wise multi-level feature fusion and enhancement strategy. Specifically, a MDCA module is designed to synergistically integrate channel and spatial information as well as global and local contexts, thereby enabling the network to efficiently capture discriminative representations of tiny objects. Moreover, the ARB and PFDH modules are introduced to alleviate feature loss during multi-scale transmission and fusion, effectively preserving structural integrity and further boosting detection accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, RS-TinyNet is the first model that achieves the most significant performance improvements on multiple RS tiny object detection benchmarks, with AP gains exceeding 4.0% on the AI-TOD dataset compared with state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, RS-TinyNet demonstrates competitive results on other RS datasets such as DIOR, highlighting its robustness and broad applicability in practical RS scenarios.
